### 1. "Miss Jerry", 1894, Movie review by IMDB user [johnny-m](https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0000021/?ref_=tt_urv):
```
While both in USA and in Europe directors were producing one-shot short films, merely of a documentary nature, 
Alexander Black had produced (arguably) the first feature of moving pictures. The photoplay 'Miss Jerry' tried its
best to create the illusion of motion, with the slides changing once every 15 seconds, while Black was effortlessly
providing the voice for every character.

Despite the handicap of the format, 'Miss Jerry' holds well if compared to a plethora of films that followed after it. 
The credit has to go to the script, which provides a charming portrayal of a countryside girl, Geraldine Holbrook
who decides to become a reporter. The romance developing between the main character and her editor is remarkably
subtle, refusing over dramatisation. Both Blanche Bayliss and William Courtenay provide memorable stills, their
emotions managing to transcend the barriers of the photos, ultimately vibrating in the eyes of the viewer.

Unknowingly, Alexander Black had set a number of themes and motives, as well as scenes, that became cliché long after
the tour of 'Miss Jerry' finished in 1907. It offered a glance in the future of film-making, when the Lumière brothers
saw no use in motion pictures. The sight was delightful.

### 3. Gohan Lapa Restaurant review, by Google reviews user [Henry Edward Hall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/w4U8ag6WT9UQzGoS7):
```
Not much atmosphere or music usually found in Asian or Japanese restaurants. 
Good menu though. 
Some of the sushi was flat and they had artificial crab which was not very authentic. 
It wasn't a bad experience but I'll try another place for sushi next time.

### 4. Iphone cellphone review, by Amazon user [Jonathan](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1JY8US3MJ4BGL/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09LPB9SQH):
```
I received this phone a few days ago and I can say that is a great phone for the price.
The only thing I could say is that it arrived with 85% battery, although I haven’t had any problems.
